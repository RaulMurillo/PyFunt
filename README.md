# PyFunt (/paɪfʊnt/)

A simple Pythonic Deep Learning Framework (WIP and CPU only at the moment)

## Requirements

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)
- [Cython](cython.org/)
- [numpy](www.numpy.org/)
- [scikit_learn](scikit-learn.org/)


## Installation

Get [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) and run:

	pip install git+git://github.com/dnlcrl/PyFunt.git

## Usage

Check this repo for an example: [Implementation of deep residual networks in PyFunt](https://github.com/dnlcrl/deep-residual-networks-pyfunt)

---
 
Check the READMEs through the directories to get more infos about each file. But you most probably want to know more about the [implemented layers](https://github.com/dnlcrl/PyFunt/tree/master/pyfunt/layers).
