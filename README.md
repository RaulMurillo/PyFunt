# PyFunt

Pythonic Deep Learning Framework (WIP)

## Description 

This repo mostly contains my solutions for Stanford's cs231n assignments (winter 2016), extended and eventually readapted, to be part of a single framework or to bring some feature from other frameworks like Torch, plus some other cool stuff.

## Requirements

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)
- [Cython](cython.org/)
- [numpy](www.numpy.org/)
- [scikit_learn](scikit-learn.org/)


## Installation

- You can get [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) and install everything by running:

		pip install git+git://github.com/dnlcrl/PyFunt.git

- **alternatively**, you can download this repo and install all requirements by running:

		pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

	then to install the `pyfunt` package you can run:

		python path/to/setup.py install
